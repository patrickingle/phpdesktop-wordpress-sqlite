# Additional Tips

This version of PHP Desktop was recompiled to force the use of port 8080 in order for WordPress to function correctly.

Once PHPDesktop is started, you can access from another browser using the url http://127.0.0.1:8080

Make sure you do not have anything running on port 8080 before starting PHPDesktop.
