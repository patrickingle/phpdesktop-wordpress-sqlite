	* pdoengine.class.php: revised pdoengine class constructor definition
	  in order to reuse the PDO instance.

	* pdodb.class.php, pdoengine.class.php: moved the foreign key check
	  from PDODB class to PDOEngine class init() method.

	* functions.php, functions-5-2.php: check if PDO instance is not null
	  to avoid displaying Zend debugger/Xdebug messages. If null, constructor
	  executes wp_die() function.

	* query_create.class.php: changed the data type rewriting method.
	  When a field name is the same as data type, e.g. "date" or "timestamp",
	  add a single quote to the field name and avoid to be rewritten.
	  This works only if the field name is on the top of the line, according
	  to the rule of dbDelta() function.

	  Added the new function to quote illegal field name, e.g. "default" or
	  "values", for SQLite. This is for the plugins that use those names to
	  create tables without errors.
